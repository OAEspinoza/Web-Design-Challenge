# Web-Design-Challenge
A website was developed using HTML, Bootstrap, and CSS. The website displays results from an analysis of the relation between different weather variables and latitude. The source data (cities.csv) contains information about Maximum Temperature, Wind Speed, Cloud Cover,  Humidity, and Latitude for 547 cities.

This website consists of the following web pages:
- Landing page (index.html)
- Data page (data.html)
- Comparison page (comparison.html)
- Visualization pages, which in turn consist of:
    - Wind speed (wind.htmll)
    - Max Temperature (temp.html)
    - Humidity (humidity.html)
    - Cloud cover (cloudiness.html)

In addition, the CSV file containing all the data was converted into html table format (table.html) using the code in the file table.ipynb.

Note: I inserted captions to the charts thumbnails in the Landing and Visualizations pages, since the font in the thumbnails is very small. This was not in the homework requirements.
